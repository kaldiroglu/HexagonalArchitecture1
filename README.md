# Ayvalık Bank CC-1

A banking application built as a learning project to practice **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters). The codebase is intentionally kept small and focused so every layer of the pattern is clearly visible.

## Objective

Demonstrate how to apply hexagonal architecture to a real domain — a simplified bank — using Java and Spring Boot. The domain layer contains zero framework imports; all Spring and JPA concerns are confined to adapters at the edges.

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Language | Java 25 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 3.4 |
| Persistence | Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL |
| Security | Spring Security (HTTP Basic Auth) |
| Validation | Jakarta Bean Validation |
| Testing | JUnit 5 · AssertJ · Mockito · MockMvc |
| Build | Maven |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose (PostgreSQL) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# Build and run all tests
mvn clean verify

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Default admin credentials: `admin@ayvalikbank.dev` / `Admin@123!`

## Domain

The domain models a bank with two roles:

- **Admin** — creates and deletes customers, sets the transfer fee, freezes/unfreezes/closes accounts
- **Customer** — opens accounts, deposits, withdraws, transfers money, changes password

Key domain rules:
- Accounts have a currency; all operations are currency-matched
- Accounts follow a state machine: `ACTIVE → FROZEN → ACTIVE`, `ACTIVE|FROZEN → CLOSED` (terminal)
- Transfers between accounts of the same customer are free; cross-customer transfers carry an admin-configured fee
- Passwords must meet a strength policy and cannot reuse the last 3 passwords

Three account types are supported, each with its own behavior:
- **CheckingAccount** — general-purpose account with a configurable overdraft limit; withdrawals may take the balance negative up to that limit
- **SavingsAccount** — no overdraft; supports monthly interest accrual (`accrueInterest`) at a configurable annual rate; accrual works on ACTIVE and FROZEN accounts
- **TimeDepositAccount** — principal is locked at opening; deposits are rejected; the account must be matured (`mature`) on or after the maturity date, which credits the full annual interest; withdrawals are only permitted after maturity

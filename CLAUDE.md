# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**Ayvalık Bank CC-1** — a hexagonal-architecture banking application in Java 25 / Spring Boot 3.4.

## Commands

```bash
# Start local PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# Build & test
mvn clean verify

# Run a single test class
mvn test -Dtest=CustomerApplicationServiceTest

# Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Architecture

The project strictly enforces the Dependency Rule: all dependencies point inward toward the domain.

```
adapter/in/web/          → REST controllers + request/response DTOs
adapter/out/persistence/ → JPA entities (DTOs), Spring Data repos, mappers, adapters
adapter/out/security/    → BCryptPasswordHasherAdapter
application/service/     → CustomerApplicationService, AccountApplicationService
config/                  → SecurityConfig (Spring beans), BankUserDetailsService
domain/model/            → Entities (Customer, Account, Transaction) + value objects (records)
domain/service/          → PasswordValidationService, TransferDomainService (pure Java)
domain/port/in/          → Use-case interfaces with nested Command records
domain/port/out/         → Repository and infrastructure interfaces
```

**Domain layer has zero Spring/JPA imports.** Domain services are instantiated as `@Bean` in `SecurityConfig` so they can be injected without becoming Spring components.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Value objects as records**: `CustomerId`, `AccountId`, `TransactionId`, `Money`, `Password` — immutable, self-validating.
- **Rich entities**: `Account` exposes `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `transferOut()`, `transferIn()` which return `Transaction` objects and enforce all invariants.
- **Password history**: `Customer` holds `currentPassword` + up to 3 previous hashes. Reuse checking (BCrypt) lives in `CustomerApplicationService` since it requires the `PasswordHasherPort`.
- **Transfer fee**: free for same-customer transfers; `TransferDomainService.calculateFee()` applies the admin-configured percentage for cross-customer transfers. Fee stored in `settings` table.
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth via Spring Security. Credentials loaded from the `customers` table by `BankUserDetailsService`. Roles: `ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER`.
- **JPA DTOs**: `CustomerJpaEntity`, `AccountJpaEntity`, `TransactionJpaEntity`, `SettingsJpaEntity`, `PasswordHistoryJpaEntity` — none of these cross the persistence adapter boundary.
